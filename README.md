#  Knee Osteoarthritis Analysis

### DetJoint
- Detecting two knee joints in X-ray images using a customized YOLOv2 model.

### ClsKL
- Classifying the KL grade of detected knee joints with a novel ordinal loss.


## Data & Models
Knee joint detection (DetJoint) and KL grading (ClsKL) training/testing datasets, as well as best models, can be downloaded from [KneeXrayData](https://figshare.com/articles/KneeXrayData/8139545), around 7G.
