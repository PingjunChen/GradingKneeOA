#  Knee Osteoarthritis Analysis
## Projects
#### DetJoint-Detect two knee joints in X-ray images automatically.
#### ClsKL-Classify the KL grade of detected knee joints automatically.
#### SegJointSpace-Delineate the space between knee joint space, for the purpose of measuring the joint space width. (in development)
#### ClsProgressor-To make prognosis on current knee joint image to see if the patient would be a fast-progressor or slow-progressor (in development).

## Data & Models
Knee joint detection (DetJoint) and KL grading (ClsKL) training/testing datasets as well as best models can be downloaded from [KneeXrayData](https://mega.nz/#!KywnQZoK!XNzDmpPFOUnKqOJpY_B7nyMEikqmhfRgYRjeq1QKw90), around 7G.
